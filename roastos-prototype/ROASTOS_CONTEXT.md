# RoastOS – System Context

## 1. Project Overview

RoastOS is an AI-assisted coffee roasting system designed to transform roasting from **process control** into **flavour control**.

The system maps:

Flavour Intent → Roast Structure → Roast Physics → Flavour Prediction → Control Action

The architecture combines:

• engineered physical priors  
• calibration from real roast data  
• machine learning models  
• predictive control optimization  

The system runs as a hybrid digital twin + estimator + MPC controller capable of recommending optimal roasting actions during a roast.

Primary goals:

• Predict flavour outcomes from roast dynamics  
• Guide roasting decisions during live roasting  
• Learn from historical roast and QC data  
• Adapt to individual roaster style and machine characteristics  

The system is being developed as a **hybrid physics + ML architecture** rather than a purely data-driven system.

# 2. Current Development Status

Project stage: **V3.0 replay-stable simulator baseline**

## 20260314
Current phase:
Data spine complete, calibration complete enough for simulator baseline, coupled replay simulator validated across multiple roasts.

Latest completed milestone:
**RoastOS V3.0 replay-stable coupled simulator baseline** frozen.

What now works end-to-end:
Cropster Excel import -> processed parquet tables -> calibration dataset -> phase-specific BT calibration -> coupled ET calibration -> latent-state normalization -> saved simulator artifact -> multi-roast replay validation.

Current baseline artifact:
`artifacts/models/physics_model_v3_0.json`

Current strategic decision:
V3.0 is frozen as the baseline plant model for controller development. Replay work continues only as robustness improvement, not as the main blocker.

Current next objectives:
1. **V3.1 replay robustness improvements**
2. **introduce central config file / config layer**
3. **V4.0 phase-aware MPC controller**

Current blocker:
No hard blocker. The simulator is stable enough to move forward.

## Current Active Issues

- Replay is stable but not uniformly strong across all roasts.
- Main weakness is late-development ET drift on some roasts.
- `PR-0180` remains a benchmark failure / stress-test roast.
- Phase is still teacher-forced in the main replay benchmark.
- Constants and paths are still too distributed across modules and should move into a shared config layer.

## V3.0 Replay Benchmark

Replay tests were run with:
- teacher-forced phase = True
- teacher-forced ET = False
- teacher-forced RoR = False

Representative results:

| Roast ID | BT RMSE | ET RMSE | Terminal BT Error | Terminal ET Error | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| PR-0173 | 36.57 | 17.87 | -0.37 | -0.55 | good baseline replay |
| PR-0181 | 31.62 | 17.51 | 4.33 | 2.00 | good baseline replay |
| PR-0182 | 34.02 | 25.22 | -22.16 | -24.11 | weak late development ET replay |
| PR-0186 | 29.98 | 19.79 | -14.71 | -17.31 | acceptable but weak late ET replay |
| PR-0180 | 58.95 | 49.80 | 37.56 | 35.49 | outlier / failure benchmark |

Interpretation:
- V3.0 is good enough to use as the baseline simulator for control development.
- Replay is acceptable on most benchmark roasts.
- Main remaining weakness is development-phase ET robustness.
- PR-0180 is retained explicitly as a stress-test roast.

## Current priorities

1. **V3.1 replay robustness improvements**
   - improve difficult-roast replay behavior
   - add batch replay benchmark support
   - keep PR-0180 as explicit stress case

2. **Central config layer**
   - move paths and shared constants out of individual files
   - centralize calibration artifact path, dataset path, replay defaults, and simulator constants

3. **V4.0 phase-aware MPC controller**
   - use V3.0 simulator as the plant model
   - keep phase-aware rollout
   - begin with gas + pressure control
   - use BT / ET tracking + move penalties as first objective

## Immediate next chat handoff

The next chat should start from this exact state:

### Closed
- V3.0 replay-stable coupled simulator baseline

### Next tasks
1. **V3.1 replay robustness improvements**
   - improve ET replay on difficult roasts
   - introduce project-wide config file / config layer
   - remove remaining hardcoded constants and file paths

2. **V4.0 phase-aware MPC controller**
   - design first clean MPC file plan
   - define objective / constraints / rollout interface
   - couple MPC to the frozen V3.0 simulator baseline

### Important strategic rule
Do not keep expanding replay calibration indefinitely before MPC.
V3.0 is already good enough to serve as the plant model baseline.

Project stage: **Phase-1 Prototype Architecture**

## 20260313
Current phase:
Data spine complete, phase-specific physics calibration complete, V2-series calibration experiments complete.

Latest completed milestone:
RoastOS Physics Calibration V2.2 completed on 16 roasts.

What now works end-to-end:
Cropster Excel import -> processed parquet tables -> calibration dataset -> phase-aware bounded physics calibration -> saved model artifacts.

Current next objective:
Build the RoastOS Roaster Simulator / digital twin forward simulator using the calibrated physics structure.

Current blocker:
No hard blocker, but calibration has now exposed a model-structure limitation:
one-step regression is no longer the main bottleneck; forward simulation is the next required step.

## Current Active Issues

- Sparse machine channels in some Cropster exports created avoidable missing values in:
  - `gas`
  - `pressure`
  - `et_delta`
- A dataset-builder fix is now prepared using within-roast forward fill only.
- Direct gas terms do not survive calibration once ET-derived variables are present.
- Current calibration is good enough to guide simulator design, but not yet a full causal machine twin.

## Physics Calibration Status

### V1 Baseline
Global bounded one-step BT-delta model.
Result:
dominated by lagged ET-BT, with low explanatory power.

### V1.1 Phase-Specific Calibration
Separate bounded models for:
- drying
- maillard
- development

Main finding:
phase separation materially improved interpretability and partially revealed richer thermal structure.

### V2 Series
Introduced:
- latent drum-energy proxy `e_drum`
- `bt_c_norm` as bean-state proxy
- tighter phase-specific calibration structure
- expanded feature variants through V2, V2.1, and V2.2

### Current best interpretation from calibration
The most stable result across 16 roasts is:

`bt_delta ≈ f(et_delta, bt_level, ror, e_drum)`

Interpretation:
- ET-BT is the dominant observable thermal driver
- BT level acts as an important proxy for bean state
- RoR acts as dynamic damping / momentum constraint
- latent machine momentum appears mainly in development
- direct gas is mostly absorbed through ET in the current data representation

### Current calibration evidence by phase
Drying:
- mostly ET-driven
- latent drum energy not yet clearly identified

Maillard:
- ET gradient + bean-state proxy + RoR are the key drivers

Development:
- ET gradient + RoR remain important
- small latent drum-energy effect survives

### Data status
Calibration dataset has now been expanded to 16 roasts.

Observed issue:
some Cropster exports contain blank machine channels while BT remains populated.
Prepared mitigation:
within-roast forward fill for machine channels only, with no backward fill and no future leakage.

## Current priorities

1. Apply dataset-builder missing-data fix and regenerate calibration dataset.
2. Freeze current calibration model family as the basis for simulation.
3. Build RoastOS Roaster Simulator:
   - state definition
   - one-step transition function
   - multi-step rollout
   - trajectory plotting / validation
4. Compare simulated trajectories to historical roast curves.
5. Use simulator as the basis for later digital twin refinement and MPC integration.

## 20260313
Current phase:
Data spine complete, baseline physics calibration complete.

Latest completed milestone:
RoastOS Physics Calibration V1 baseline completed successfully.

What now works end-to-end:
Cropster Excel import -> processed parquet tables -> calibration dataset -> bounded physics calibration -> saved model artifact.

Current next objective:
Build V1.1 phase-specific calibration.

Current blocker:
No blocker. Pipeline is operational.

## Current Active Issues

- Global physics calibration V1 explains only a small part of BT step variance.
- V1 selected lagged ET-BT as dominant predictor and set gas, pressure, and RoR coefficients to zero.
- This suggests current one-step linear formulation is too compressed for richer machine-physics identification.

## Physics Calibration Status

### V1 Baseline
Model type:
Bounded linear one-step BT delta model.

Target:
bt_delta = bt_next - bt_c

Features used:
- intercept
- gas
- gas_lag1
- et_delta
- et_delta_lag1
- neg_pressure
- neg_pressure_lag1
- neg_ror

Training dataset:
- 6164 rows loaded
- 6156 usable training rows after dropping missing lagged rows
- 8 roasts

V1 result:
- intercept = -0.322164
- gas = 0
- gas_lag1 = 0
- et_delta = 0
- et_delta_lag1 = 0.011820
- neg_pressure = 0
- neg_pressure_lag1 = 0
- neg_ror = 0

Diagnostics:
- RMSE = 1.284449
- MAE = 0.642282
- R² = 0.060771

Interpretation:
V1 behaves as a minimal lagged thermal-response model, dominated by lagged ET-BT.
